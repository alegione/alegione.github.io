Twitter is the social media hub of choice for a vast array of academics. It's a great place to share your latest work, ask questions of experts, communicate your research field to the general public and engage in the general discourse of your community. It can potentially be a hive of politically charged vitriol too, but we can hopefully avoid swimming in those circles more often than not.

This guide will take you through the basics of setting up a profile, and working through the basics of a 'tweet', your 'timeline', your 'followers', 'likes' and 'retweets'. There is a decent amount of platform specific terminology (much of it general parlance for social media these days), but we'll get through it together.

## What you need to start with
- A photo
- A short (~160 characters) biography
- An email address or mobile phone number (for account verification)

## Signing up for Twitter
Signing up for Twitter is a pretty easy and straight forward process.
1. Go to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) and select 'Sign up'
2. Provide your name, phone number OR email, and your date of birth
3. You will receive a verification code via phone OR email (whichever you selected). Enter this and you're good to go!

## Picking a good username
After you sign in for the first time, you may notice you've been given a 'handle' (the username that begins with an @) automatically. This will probably be something along the lines of your first name and a bunch of numbers. You should change this immediately to something more user friendly.

1. Go to 'Settings' (designated by a small cog or gear icon)
2. Select 'Account'
3. Select 'Username'
4. Type in whatever you'd like, Twitter will suggest alternates that are available (no two people can have the same handle)
5. You can now link to your twitter profile with the web address 'twitter.com/yourname' (e.g. twitter.com/alegione)

__Some tips for your handle:__
+ Don't make it overly lengthy: tweets can only be 280 characters and you don't want 20 characters being used up by your name if someone wants to mention you
+ If you can get your name, or close to it, then it's the best option as it's easier for people to search
+ Make it something that's easy to say out loud or read on a slide
	* Avoid substituting letters for numbers if it will mean someone reading you name in print form won't be able to simply interpret it (e.g. @5imon or @0liver)
+ If you can only make the start similar to name, do that at least, as it increases the odds of appearing dynamically as someone is typing in your name (e.g. @AlistairTheDoctor versus @DoctorAlistair)

## Setting up your profile page
Now that you've set up your account and username, it's time to fill out your profile page. This is a relatively painless process. Just select the little avatar icon in the menu, then on the right hand side select 'Edit profile'.

You can do the following:
1. Add your profile picture
2. Add a background picture (personalise this towards your interests, work or otherwise)
3. Change your name, for example you could add 'PhD' or an emoji to the end of your name
	+ Warning: Emoji's don't display consistently across browsers/operating systems, don't use an emoji as your entire username
4. Add a biography, including your research interests, and where in the world you work (using your institute's handle is a good idea here).
5. Include a web link, ideally this will be to your institute profile page, or somewhere that contains your contact email.
