The goal of improving your online profile is that when people search your name, you'll appear near the top (or ideally at the top) of the search results. I'd say globally the majority of people at time of writing will be searching using Google, so it makes sense to set up your Google Scholar profile too. Since lots of people search for papers through this service nowadays too, having a scholar page has the added benefit of adding a 'clickable' link to your name when your papers are searched. This link takes them through to your profile page where they can find even more of your papers! How convenient.

## What you need to start with
Not much! If you have a Gmail account you're almost done. The following will help you complete a full profile.
+ A Gmail account
+ An institutional (e.g. Univeristy) email account
+ A photo, ideally the same one you've used in your other profiles
+ 4 - 5 keywords that describe your research interested (e.g. Microbiology, Salmonella, Genomics)
+ A good idea of which papers you've published!


## Setting up your Google Scholar profile
1. Go to the [Google Scholar](scholar.google.com) page
2. Click on 'My Profile', you'll be taken to a set up page like the below

3. Add your institutional email (or you won't be able to set up your page), and add a webpage such as your institutional profile page
4. Add some broad keywords that describe the field you work in
	+ These become hyperlinks to find other Scholars that work in the same field
5. You'll be presented with all the papers Google thinks you've published, based on your name. Go through the list and remove any papers that don't belong to you, if you have an uncommon name this should be pretty straight forward

6. Finally you'll have the option to update your profile automatically, or set it so that Google will send you an email to review new papers of yours that it finds. Again if you have an uncommon name, stick with the automatic updates.

Your profile is now almost complete, you just need to add your photo (simply click on the empty profile image), and tidy up any duplicate papers. 
	
## Tidying up your Google Scholar profile

If you've ever published a pre-print, using a service such as BioRxiv for example, then your paper will appear in your Google Scholar profile in both forms (pre-print and final publication). To merge the citations into one for metric purposes, you can easily select the appropriate papers by clicking on the checkbox on the left hand side of each entry. Following this, click on the 'merge' option that appears in the top toolbar, and select which of the versions you'd like to retain in your profile.

## Using your Google Scholar Profile
Scholar profiles are a great succinct way of finding your current metrics, including citations broken down by year, h index (the number (_h_) of papers with at least _h_ citations), and i10 index (the number of papers with over 10 citations). You can also sort your research output by year of publication or number of citations, and easily select papers and export the citations in various formats.

A few days after you've set up your profile, check back in and you'll notice that Google is suggesting 'Co-authors', which it populates by linking the papers you've claimed with those who also have Google Scholar profiles attached to those same works.

If you want to utilise your Google Scholar profile even further, why not try out my RShiny tool [**'Scholar Plot'**](https://alegione.github.io/2020/ScholarPlot), which can be used to plot research metrics by year and produce a table of your research broken down by impact (Impact factor of journal + citations per year since publication). The plot you can find on my  [Publications](https://alegione.github.io/publications/) page was generated using this tool.
