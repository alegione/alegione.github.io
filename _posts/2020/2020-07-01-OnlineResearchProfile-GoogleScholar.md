The goal of improving your online profile is that when people search your name, you'll appear near the top (or ideally at the top) of the search results. I'd say globally the majority of people at time of writing will be searching using Google, so it makes sense to set up your Google Scholar profile too. Since lots of people search for papers through this service nowadays too, having a scholar page has the added benefit of adding a 'clickable' link to your name when your papers are searched. This link takes them through to your profile page where they can find even more of your papers! How convenient.

## What you need to start with
Not much! If you have a Gmail account you're almost done. The following will help you complete a full profile.
+ A Gmail account
+ An institutional (e.g. Univeristy) email account
+ A photo, ideally the same one you've used in your other profiles
+ 4 - 5 keywords that describe your research interested (e.g. Microbiology, Salmonella, Genomics)
+ A good idea of which papers you've published!


## Setting up your Google Scholar profile
1. Go to the [Google Scholar](scholar.google.com) page
2. Click on 'My Profile', you'll be taken to a set up page like the below

	+ These become hyperlinks to find other Scholars that work in the same field
5. You'll be presented with all the papers Google thinks you've published, based on your name. Go through the list and remove any papers that don't belong to you, if you have an uncommon name this should be pretty straight forward

6. Finally you'll have the option to update your profile automatically, or set it so that Google will send you an email to review new papers of yours that it finds. Again if you have an uncommon name, stick with the automatic updates.

## Tidying up your Google Scholar profile
If you've ever published a pre-print, using a service such as BioRxiv for example, then your paper will appear in your Google Scholar profile in both forms (pre-print and final publication). To merge the citations into one for metric purposes, you can mere
