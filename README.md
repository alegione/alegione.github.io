## Read Me

This is the personal website of me, Alistair Legione!
It contains some basic CV information, any random writing that I do, as well as links to to my Twitter, Github, Work, and Google Scholar pages.

It also works as a home for links to any Shiny Apps I've muddled together, github tools I'm working on or have made, or a place to put any other of my writing/talks/work
