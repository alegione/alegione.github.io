The aim of this piece is to introduce you to recording audio, and if needed video, through Microsoft PowerPoint to suitably record lectures for teaching.

I'm going to start off with the basics, and then add in a few more complex examples further on.

**Note:** This guide is focused on using Office 365 for Windows 10. If you're using a MacOS you may face issues that I don't address. Google is the best place to go to solve any problem you may have
