The aim of this piece is to introduce you to recording audio, and if needed video, through Microsoft PowerPoint to suitably record lectures for teaching.

I'm going to start off with the basics, and then add in a few more complex examples further on.


**Note:** _This guide is focused on using Office 365 for Windows 10. If you're using a MacOS you may face issues that I don't address. Google is the best place to go to solve any problem you may have_

# Activating the Record Ribbon table
Whilst you can activate the record functions in PowerPoint via a few different routes, if you're going to be recording whole lectures, or making videos, then the best thing to do is activate the recording ribbon.


# Basic voice recording of a lecture
Once you've set up your slides as required (animations, transitions, etc), you can select the 'record slide' option to bring up the recording view. Primarily here you'll find your left and right arrows at either side of the slide, and up the top your record/stop/play buttons. To turn video on/off (i.e. to show your face or not), there are some buttons in the bottom right hand side of the screen.

To record yourself, click on the 'record' button. You'll get a 3-2-1 countdown, and the recording will start after that.
+ To activate an animation, click on the right/next arrow.
+ To pause the recording without ending it, select 'pause'
+ To stop the recording altogether, hit 'stop'
+ To use the pointer, right click on the slide, select 'pointer options', and pick 'laser pointer'
+ If you'd prefer to have the mouse visible at all times instead, 'right click' on the slide, select 'pointer options', select 'mouse options', and select 'visible'
+ If you transition to the next slide, the recording continue stay
